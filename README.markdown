# Inter-App Communication

## x-callback-url made easy

Inter-App Communication, **IAC** from now on, is a framework that allows your iOS app to communicate, very easily, with other iOS apps installed in the device that supports the [**x-callback-url**](http://x-callback-url.com/) protocol. With **IAC** you can also add an **x-callback-url** **API** to your app in a very easy and intuitive way.

**IAC** currently supports the **x-callback-url** [1.0 DRAFT specification](http://x-callback-url.com/specifications/).


## Usage

### Call external app

From anywhere in your app you can call any external app on the device with the following code

```objective-c
#import "IACClient.h"

IACClient *client = [IACClient clientWithURLScheme:@"appscheme"];
[client performAction@"action" parameters:@{@"param1": value1, @"param2": value2}];
```


You can also use, if available, client subclasses for the app you are calling. Within the framework there are clients for Instapaper and Google Chrome and many more will be added in the future. 

For example, to add a url to Instapaper from your app, you can do:

* Without specific client class:

```objective-c
#import "IACClient.h"

IACClient *client = [IACClient clientWithURLScheme:@"x-callback-instapaper"];
[client performAction@"add" parameters:@{@"url": @"http://tapsandswipes.com"}];
```

* With the client class specific for Instapaper:

```objective-c
#import "InstapaperIACClient.h"

[[InstapaperIACClient client] add:@"http://tapsandswipes.com"];
```


### Receive callbacks from the external app

If you want to be called back from the external app you can specify success and failure handler blocks, for example:

```objective-c
IACClient *client = [IACClient clientWithURLScheme:@"appscheme"];
[client performAction:@"action"
            parameters:@{@"param1": value1, @"param2": value2}
            onSuccess:^(NSDictionary *resultParams){
                NSLog(@"The app response was: %@", resultParams)
            }
            onFailure:^(NSError *error){
                NSLog(@"ERROR: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
            }
];
```

 
For the callbacks to work, your app must support the **x-callback-url** protocol. The easiest way is to let **IAC** manage that.

### Add x-callback-url support to your app

Follow these simple steps to add **x-callback-url** support to your app:

1. Define the url scheme that your app will respond to in the `Info.plist` of your app. See the section **Implementing Custom URL Schemes** in [this article](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/AdvancedAppTricks/AdvancedAppTricks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH7-SW50).
 
2. Assign this scheme to the IACManager instance with `[IACManager sharedManager].callbackURLScheme = @"myappscheme";`. I recommend doing this in the delegate method `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

3. Call `-handleOpenURL:` from the URL handling method in the app`s delegate. For example:

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url 
    sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
            
    return [[IACManager sharedManager] handleOpenURL:url];
}
```

With these three steps your app will be available to call other apps and receive callbacks from them.

### Add an x-callback-url API to your app

If you want to add an external **API** to your app through the **x-callback-url** protocol you can use any of these two options or both:

- Add handler blocks for your actions directly to the `IACManager` instance calling `-handleAction:withBlock:` for each action.

- Implement the `IACDelegate` protocol in any of your classes and assign the delegate to the `IACManager` instance, preferably in the app delegate `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

Action handlers take precedence over the delegate for the same action.

Explore the sample code to see all of these in place.



## Installation

#### Via CocoaPods
 
The easiest way to install **IAC** is via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add this line to your Podfile:
 
```sh
pod 'InterAppCommunication'
```

and run `pod install`. 
 
#### Manual
 
You can also install it manually by copying to your project the contents of the directory `InterAppCommunication`.

Within the directory `AppClients` you can find clients for some apps, copy the files for the client you want to use to your project. 


### Requirements

* **IAC** uses ARC but it may be used with non-ARC projects by setting the: ` -fobjc-arc ` compiler flag on all ` IAC*.m ` files. You can set this flag under Target -> Build Phases -> Compile Sources
* Requires iOS 5.0+ and Xcode 4.3+.



## Create an IAC client class for your app

If you have an app that already have an x-callback-url API, you can help other apps to communicate with your app by creating an `IACClient` subclass and share these classes with them.

This way you can implement the exposed API as if the app were an internal component within the caller app. You can implement the methods with the required parameters and even make some validation before the call is made.

Inside the `AppClients` directory you can find all the client subclasses currently implemented. If you have implemented one for your own app, do not hesitate to contact me and I will add it to the repository.
